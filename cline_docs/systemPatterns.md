# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
1. Blockchain Layer
   - Ethereum mainnet with Layer 2 integration
   - Smart contracts for governance and token management
   - Multi-sig security and upgradeable contracts

2. AI Agent Layer
   - TypeScript-based agent framework
   - Modular architecture for different roles (CEO, CFO, CTO)
   - Decision pipeline with monitoring and validation

3. Web Interface Layer
   - Next.js 14 frontend
   - Tailwind CSS styling
   - Framer Motion animations
   - Vercel deployment

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Smart Contract Design
   - ERC-20 token standard for SADL
   - Modular contract architecture
   - Role-based access control
   - Emergency pause functionality

2. AI Agent Framework
   - TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
   - Interface-driven development
   - Event-driven communication
   - Test-driven development approach

3. Frontend Architecture
   - Component-based UI structure
   - React hooks for state management
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

## Integration Patterns
1. Smart Contract Integration
   - Web3.js for blockchain interaction
   - Type-safe contract interfaces
   - Event listening for real-time updates

2. AI Agent Communication
   - Message bus for inter-agent communication
   - Event emitter for system-wide events
   - Protocol types for standardized messages

3. Frontend-Backend Integration
   - API routes for data fetching
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Type-safe data contracts
