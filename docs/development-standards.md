# Development Standards

## Code Reviews
1. All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer
2. Code reviews should focus on:
   - Code quality and maintainability
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications
   - Adherence to architectural patterns
3. Use GitHub pull requests for all code changes

## Type Usage
1. Always use TypeScript types for:

## Cross-Package Dependencies
1. Use clear interfaces for inter-package communication
2. Document all cross-package dependencies
3. Avoid circular dependencies between packages
4. Use semantic versioning for package releases

## Testing Standards
1. Write unit tests for all critical functionality
2. Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
3. Use integration tests for cross-package functionality
4. Write end-to-end tests for key user workflows

## Documentation
1. Maintain up-to-date README files for all packages
2. Document all public APIs
3. Keep architecture diagrams current
4. Document all major design decisions
