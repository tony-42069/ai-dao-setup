# Slack Integration Architecture

## Overview
The Slack integration enables communication between the AI DAO system and Slack channels. It uses the Slack Bolt framework and a custom message bus for internal communication.

## Components
1. **SlackApp**
   - Main entry point for Slack integration
   - Handles Slack events and commands
   - Routes messages to internal message bus

2. **SlackGateway**
   - Manages Slack API connections
   - Handles authentication and token management
   - Implements rate limiting and error handling

3. **MessageBus**
   - Internal communication system
   - Routes messages between Slack and other system components
   - Implements message queuing and delivery guarantees

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Set up OAuth permissions:
   - `channels:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `commands`
3. Configure event subscriptions:
   - `message.channels`
   - `app_mention`
4. Set up slash commands as needed
5. Add bot to desired channels

## Message Flow
1. Slack event received by SlackApp
2. Event validated and transformed
3. Message sent to MessageBus
4. Message routed to appropriate handler
5. Response sent back through MessageBus
6. Response posted to Slack channel

## Error Handling
- Failed messages are retried with exponential backoff
- Critical errors are logged and notified to admins
- Rate limiting is handled automatically
